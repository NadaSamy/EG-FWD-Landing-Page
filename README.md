# Landing Page Project

Landing Page project is the first project in the Front End Web Development Professional NanoDegree Program.

I uploaded the starter code and edited the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to meet the project rubric requirements.
In the HTML, I added a fourth section and added a buttom at the end to the page using a div and an anchor tag which using JavaScript it makes the user scroll to the top of the page.

In the CSS file, I edited the menu_link class, I changed the display to inline-flex in order to have the sections in the navbar on the same line. I also added styling for the new button that allows the user to scroll to the top.

In the JavaScript file, I added three functions. These functions allowed me to add sections to the navbar and then add the active class for the section in view port. I also applied some code for the functionality of the button to make the user scroll to the top of the page.
